## Synopsis

> "How much parallelism should I have?"

The above is a common enough question and one that can be answered with some
pretty simple math. Unfortunately some of the math is completely
counter-intuitive. This tool helps demonstrate how your algorithms are
currently performing, why they are currently performing the way they are
and act as a way to help talk about the properties of what is causing the
actual situations we find ourselves in.
